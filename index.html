            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>The Selwyn College Christian Union (SCCU) is made up of a group of Christians in Selwyn College. Our aim
                is to make Jesus Christ
                known to students in college, as well as to help each other to grow in our relationship with God. We are
                part of the Cambridge
                Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, CICCU. We don't have any links to any particular church – we welcome
                Christians from all backgrounds!
            <h2>What do we do?</h2>
            <p>We meet together every week, to read the Bible together and pray. This isn't an intense Bible study, but
                it's a chance to grow together as a community, and to encourage and equip each other to live out our
                faith in all aspects of university life. We also run events each term to give us opportunities to tell
                our friends about Jesus!
            </p>
            <h2>How can you get in touch?</h2>
            <p>Every college has 2 reps, who run the Christian Union group in their college. In Selwyn the reps this
                year are Cian Williams (cdw45@cam.ac.uk) and Dominic Dale (djd63@cam.ac.uk). Send an email to Cian or Dom (it doesn't matter which one!)
                and say hi. We'd love to answer any questions you have, or just say hello, so please do send us an
                email!
            </p>
